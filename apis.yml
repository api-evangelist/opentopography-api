  OpenTopography API is a web service that provides users with access to
  high-resolution topographic data and tools for analysis and visualization. The
  API allows users to query a vast collection of LiDAR and other topographic
  data from around the world, making it easier for researchers, engineers, and
  scientists to study the Earth's surface and its features. With the
  OpenTopography API, users can easily access digital elevation models, point
  cloud data, and other geospatial information, helping them to better
  understand and analyze the Earth's topography. Additionally, the API provides
  various tools for data processing and visualization, making it a valuable
  resource for a wide range of applications in geosciences, environmental
  research, and other fields.
